# Copy this file to .env and fill the values before running the backend

# Set your OpenAI API key if you want /upload and /summary to work
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Notes:
# - Generate a secure `API_KEY` (a random string) and set it here. This value is
#   required by the iOS frontend which must send it as the `x-api-key` header.
# - Do NOT commit your `.env` file. Keep it out of version control.
# - In the iOS app, add the same key to `Info.plist` under the `API_KEY` key so
#   the mobile client can automatically read and send it in requests.
